# SQL Practice Exercises â€“ Employees Dataset

Welcome to this **SQL Practice Repository**!  
This exercise set is designed for learners from **Beginner to Advanced** levels.  
We are using a sample **Employees dataset** with columns like:

- `EmpID`
- `Name`
- `Salary`
- `DoJ` (Date of Joining)
- `Dept` (Department)
- `Age`
- `City`

Each level contains **20 progressive SQL questions**.
